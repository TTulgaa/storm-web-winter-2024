        <p><b>Welcome to My Exercise Plan!</b></p>
        <br>
        <p>Are you ready to get started on your fitness journey?
            This simple exercise plan will help you build a foundation
            for a healthier and more active lifestyle.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Day 1: Walking</b></p>
        <br>
        <p>Start with a 15-minute brisk walk around your neighborhood
            or a nearby park. Focus on maintaining good posture and breathing
            rhythmically.</p>
        <br>  <p><b>Day 2: Stretching</b></p>
        <br>
        <p>Perform a 10-minute stretching routine to improve flexibility.
            Include stretches for your neck, shoulders, arms, legs, and back.</p>
        <br>  <p><b>Day 3: Squats</b></p>
        <br>
        <p>Do 3 sets of 10 squats. Squats are great for building lower body strength.
            Keep your back straight, and go as low as you comfortably can.</p>
        <br>  <p><b>Day 4: Rest</b></p>
        <br>
        <p>Rest is essential for muscle recovery. Take a break today and focus on
            staying hydrated.</p>
