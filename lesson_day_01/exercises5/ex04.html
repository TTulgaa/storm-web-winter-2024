            "Astronaut" technically applies to all human space travelers
            regardless of nationality.
            
            However, astronauts fielded by Russia or the Soviet Union are
            typically known instead as cosmonauts (from the Russian "kosmos"
            (космос), meaning "space", also borrowed from Greek).
